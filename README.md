# Tokenlist component for Knockout JS
Replacement for multi-select boxes, similar to jQuery select2's tagging support. This component basically creates an input box with an autocomplete dropdown. Entries are added and displayed as tokens/tags and submitted by the form as a `<select multiple>...</select>`.

## Using
Just clone this repo, open `index.html` in your browser, and look at the examples. This demo includes the tokenlist component and shows you how to use it.

## Dependencies
Only Knockout JS.
